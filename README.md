sshknownhostsrole
=================

This is an ansible role that manages the SSH known hosts file usually located at `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts` or `~user/.ssh/known_hosts`.

The main purpose of this role is to wrap the sshknownhosts module located at https://github.com/bfmartin/ansible-sshknownhosts and make it suitable for Ansible Galaxy.

Requirements
------------

Any Unix-like system with an openssh server should work.

Security
--------

> If an ssh_known_hosts file is constructed using ssh-keyscan without
> verifying the keys, users will be vulnerable to man in the middle
> attacks.  On the other hand, if the security model allows such a risk,
> ssh-keyscan can help in the detection of tampered keyfiles or man in
> the middle attacks which have begun after the ssh_known_hosts file was
> created.

(taken from the ssh-keyscan man page)

Therefore, you can specify a fingerprint manually by providing the `fingerprint` attribute.


Role Variables

`ssh_known_hosts_keyscan`: The program to use to scan with. The default is ssh-keyscan in the current path.

`ssh_known_hosts`: List of dictionaries the host and its attributes to scan:

```
ssh_known_hosts:
  - name: example.com
    state: present
    dest: /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts
    enctype: rsa
    port: 22
    keyscan: ssh-keyscan
    aliases:
